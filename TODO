* Parallel compilation
* Be able to build itself (in parallel, with -odir -hidir)

* Support building libraries (use -main-is?)
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)
* Release 0.1 version
* Announce the release

* Fix reported bugs
* Release 0.1.1/2/..

* Support -odir != -hidir (w/tests)
* Test w/o '-odir -hidir' (requires recursively cleaning up the test data dir)
* Support -hisuf/-osuf/etc (needed for building profiling versions)
* Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
* Look at how GHC does the timestamp check
* Cache timestamp checks (is it worth it? Need a parallel writable map)
* Test on Windows
