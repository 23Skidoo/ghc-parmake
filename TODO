Next release:

* A ghc-par executable (drop-in replacement for ghc) + ghc-parmake as a synonym
  for 'ghc-par --make'.
* Support -odir != -hidir (w/tests)
* Support for other redirection flags (see
  http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/7.2.1/html/users_guide/separate-compilation.html#options-output
  ) (w/tests)
* Test w/o '-odir -hidir' (requires recursively cleaning up the test data dir)
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)
* Test on Windows
* Release version 0.2
* Announce the release

Next+1 release:

* Move to multiple process architecture with N persistent GHCs. Look at Evan
  Laforge's ghc-server work (
  http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/glasgow-haskell-users/2012-February/021907.html
  ).
* Release version 0.3

Misc. ideas:

* Support dependencies added with the DEPENDS pragma/#included files (w/tests)
  (see http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/ghc/ticket/4900)
* Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
* Look at how GHC does the timestamp check
* Cache timestamp checks (is it worth it? Need a parallel writable map)
