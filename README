This is slowly evolving into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

Usage: ghc-parmake -j N MyModule.hs [$GHC_OPTIONS] [$RTS_OPTIONS]

TODO:

* Support -odir -hidir
* Add functional tests (HUnit).
* Tests with .lhs/.lhs-boot
* Tests with -odir -hidir
* Parallel compilation
* Be able to build itself (in parallel, with -odir -hidir)

* Support building libraries (just -main-is?)
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)

Later:

* Support -odir != -hidir
* Parse -odir and print prettier output
* Support -hisuf/-osuf/etc (needed for building profiling versions)
* Cache timestamp checks
* Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
* Test on Windows
