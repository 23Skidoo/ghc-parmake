'ghc-parmake' is a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make' intended to work as its
drop-in replacement. It can build your Haskell program in parallel using
multiple cores and will be integrated with 'cabal build' eventually (though I
also plan to support the standalone version).

'ghc-parmake' works by first extracting a module dependency graph with 'ghc -M'
and then running multiple 'ghc -c' processes in parallel. Currently, it can
build itself and some small test programs (see the 'tests' directory).

To set the number of concurrent jobs, use the '-j' option.

Usage: ghc-parmake OPTS FILES

Options:

-j N             - Run N jobs in parallel.
--ghc-path=PATH  - Set the path to the ghc executable.

-vv[N]           - Set verbosity to N (only for ghc-parmake). 
                   N is 0-3, default 1.
-v[N]            - Set verbosity to N (both for GHC and ghc-parmake itself).
--help           - Print usage information.
-V               - Print version information.


Other options are passed to GHC unmodified.

Known limitations:

      * Build fails when -odir != -hidir.
      * -hisuf/-osuf are not supported (needed when building libs for profiling).
      * Tested only on Linux.
