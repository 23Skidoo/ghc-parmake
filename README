This is slowly evolving into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

Usage: ghc-parmake -j N MyModule.hs [$GHC_OPTIONS] [$RTS_OPTIONS]

TODO:

* Remove .hi/.hi-boot nodes from the build graph (we only need to keep this info
  in the target's dependencies list) - edges should go directly from .o to .o,
  but dependencies should list .hi.
* Serial compilation (feature parity with 'ghc --make')
* Parallel compilation
* Be able to build itself & simple test projects
* Add functional tests (HUnit).
* Tests with .lhs/.lhs-boot
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)

* Later: Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
