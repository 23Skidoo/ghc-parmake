This is slowly evolving into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

Usage: ghc-parmake -j N MyProgram.hs [$GHC_OPTIONS] [$RTS_OPTIONS]

Known deficiencies:

      * Building libraries is not yet supported.
      * Build fails when -odir != -hidir.
      * -hisuf/-osuf are not supported (needed for building libs for profiling).
      * Tested only on Linux.
