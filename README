This is slowly evolving into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

Usage: ghc-parmake -j N MyModule.hs [$GHC_OPTIONS] [$RTS_OPTIONS]

TODO:

* Verbose output a-la cabal-install/ suppport for the -v option

* Serial compilation (feature parity with 'ghc --make'):
    * Guess output filename (ghc --make Main.hs => ./Main)
    * Support -o option
    * Relink only when something has changed

* Add functional tests (HUnit).
* Tests with .lhs/.lhs-boot
* Parallel compilation
* Be able to build itself & simple test projects

* Support building libraries
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)

* Later: Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
