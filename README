This is supposed to evolve into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

TODO:

* Serial compilation (feature parity with 'ghc --make')
* Mutually recursive modules
* Parallel compilation
* Nicer user interface (see http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447)
