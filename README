'ghc-parmake' is a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make': it can build your Haskell
program using multiple cores. It is intended to work as a drop-in replacement
for 'ghc --make' (and eventually will be integrated into 'cabal build').

Usage: ghc-parmake OPTS FILES

Options:

-j N    - Run N jobs in parallel.
-vv[N]  - Set verbosity to N (only for ghc-parmake). N is 0-3, default 1.
-v[N]   - Set verbosity to N (both for GHC and ghc-parmake itself).
--help  - Print usage information.
-V      - Print version information.

Other options are passed to GHC unmodified.

Known limitations:

      * Building libraries is not yet supported.
      * Build fails when -odir != -hidir.
      * -hisuf/-osuf are not supported (needed for building libs for profiling).
      * Tested only on Linux.
