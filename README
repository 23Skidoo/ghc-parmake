This is slowly evolving into a parallel wrapper for 'ghc --make'. I plan to
integrate it with 'cabal build' eventually.

Usage: ghc-parmake -j N MyModule.hs [$GHC_OPTIONS] [$RTS_OPTIONS]

TODO:

* Add support for mutually recursive modules (just recognize .hs-boot and
  .hi-boot extensions)
* Remove .hi/.hi-boot nodes from the build graph (we only need to keep this info
  in the target's dependencies list)
* Move planTargetOf/planVertexOf back into BuildPlan and add a custom Show
  instance for debugging.
* Serial compilation (feature parity with 'ghc --make')
* Parallel compilation
* Be able to build itself & simple test projects
* Add functional tests (HUnit).
* Test on some large project (e.g. Darcs/Agda)

* Later: Nicer user interface (see
  http://hackage.haskell.org/trac/hackage/ticket/447 )
